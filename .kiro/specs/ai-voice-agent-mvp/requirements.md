# AI Voice Agent MVP - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a working demo MVP of an AI voice agent that can receive incoming calls and handle conversations intelligently. The MVP will demonstrate the core functionality without authentication complexity, focusing on the essential voice agent capabilities using Twilio ConversationRelay, OpenAI GPT, ElevenLabs voice synthesis, and AWS infrastructure.

The goal is to create a functional demo where someone can call a phone number, have a natural conversation with an AI agent that can access a knowledge base, and receive intelligent responses in real-time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Incoming Call Handling

**User Story:** As a caller, I want to call a phone number and immediately connect with an AI voice agent, so that I can get assistance without waiting for a human operator.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a caller dials the Twilio phone number THEN the system SHALL answer the call within 2 rings
2. WHEN the call is answered THEN the system SHALL immediately connect to Twilio ConversationRelay
3. WHEN ConversationRelay is established THEN the system SHALL play a greeting message using ElevenLabs voice synthesis
4. IF the ConversationRelay connection fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to a pre-recorded greeting message
5. WHEN the call is connected THEN the system SHALL log the call start time and caller information

### Requirement 2: Real-time Voice Conversation

**User Story:** As a caller, I want to have a natural conversation with the AI agent using my voice, so that I can communicate naturally without typing or using complex interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the caller speaks THEN Twilio ConversationRelay SHALL transcribe the speech to text in real-time
2. WHEN speech transcription is received THEN the system SHALL process the text with OpenAI GPT within 2 seconds
3. WHEN GPT generates a response THEN the system SHALL convert the text to speech using ElevenLabs within 1 second
4. WHEN the audio is generated THEN the system SHALL stream the response back to the caller via ConversationRelay
5. WHEN the caller interrupts the AI response THEN the system SHALL stop the current audio and listen for new input
6. WHEN there is silence for more than 3 seconds THEN the system SHALL prompt the caller to continue
7. IF any service fails THEN the system SHALL provide an appropriate error message to the caller

### Requirement 3: Knowledge Base Integration

**User Story:** As a caller, I want the AI agent to provide accurate information based on the company's knowledge base, so that I get relevant and helpful responses to my questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI receives a question THEN it SHALL search the knowledge base for relevant information
2. WHEN relevant information is found THEN the AI SHALL incorporate it into the response naturally
3. WHEN no relevant information is found THEN the AI SHALL politely indicate it doesn't have that specific information
4. WHEN the knowledge base is empty THEN the AI SHALL use general conversational abilities
5. WHEN multiple relevant documents are found THEN the AI SHALL synthesize information from multiple sources
6. WHEN the caller asks for specific details THEN the AI SHALL provide accurate information from the knowledge base

### Requirement 4: Call Management and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all calls to be properly logged and managed, so that I can monitor system performance and review conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a call starts THEN the system SHALL create a call record with timestamp, caller ID, and unique call ID
2. WHEN the conversation progresses THEN the system SHALL log all transcriptions and AI responses
3. WHEN the call ends THEN the system SHALL update the call record with end time and call duration
4. WHEN the call is completed THEN the system SHALL generate a call summary using AI
5. WHEN call data is stored THEN it SHALL be persisted in the database for future retrieval
6. WHEN system errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate error levels
7. WHEN the call exceeds 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL warn about potential costs and offer to continue

### Requirement 5: Configuration and Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily configure and deploy the MVP system, so that I can quickly set up a working demo environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the system THEN it SHALL require only essential API keys (Twilio, OpenAI, ElevenLabs)
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate all required API keys and configurations
3. WHEN API keys are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what's needed
4. WHEN the system is configured THEN it SHALL automatically set up Twilio webhook endpoints
5. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide a health check endpoint showing service status
6. WHEN deploying with Docker THEN all services SHALL start correctly with docker-compose up
7. WHEN the system is ready THEN it SHALL display the phone number to call for testing

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a caller, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and continue working even when some services have issues, so that my call experience is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenAI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use a fallback response mechanism
2. WHEN ElevenLabs API fails THEN the system SHALL use text-to-speech alternatives or pre-recorded messages
3. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue handling calls but log errors
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry operations with exponential backoff
5. WHEN ConversationRelay disconnects THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
6. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully end the call with an apology message
7. WHEN services recover THEN the system SHALL resume normal operation without restart

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the AI voice agent to respond quickly and handle multiple calls simultaneously, so that the experience feels natural and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing speech input THEN the AI response SHALL be generated within 3 seconds
2. WHEN converting text to speech THEN the audio SHALL be ready within 2 seconds
3. WHEN multiple calls are active THEN each call SHALL maintain independent conversation context
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN response times SHALL not exceed 5 seconds
5. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL clean up old conversation data
6. WHEN CPU usage exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL log performance warnings
7. WHEN handling concurrent calls THEN the system SHALL support at least 5 simultaneous conversations

### Requirement 8: Basic Analytics and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor system performance and call metrics, so that I can ensure the system is working properly and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calls are processed THEN the system SHALL track call volume, duration, and success rates
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL monitor response times and error rates
3. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide real-time status via a simple dashboard endpoint
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be categorized and counted for analysis
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log warnings with relevant metrics
6. WHEN daily operations complete THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report
7. WHEN the system restarts THEN it SHALL preserve essential metrics and logs
