# Project Cleanup Requirements

## Introduction

The AI Voice Agent MVP project has accumulated multiple redundant documentation files, duplicate implementations, and unnecessary artifacts during development. This cleanup will streamline the project structure, remove confusion, and maintain only the essential files needed for the working MVP.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Redundant Documentation Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean documentation structure so that I can quickly find the information I need without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing project documentation THEN there SHALL be only essential documentation files
2. WHEN a developer needs setup instructions THEN they SHALL find one clear setup guide
3. WHEN looking for project status THEN there SHALL be one authoritative status document
4. IF multiple files contain similar information THEN only the most comprehensive and current version SHALL remain

### Requirement 2: Remove Duplicate Frontend Implementation Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, clean dashboard implementation so that there's no confusion about which file to modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the dashboard directory THEN there SHALL be only one page.tsx file
2. WHEN the main dashboard page is accessed THEN it SHALL use the working, integrated implementation
3. IF alternative implementations exist THEN they SHALL be removed to prevent confusion
4. WHEN developers need to modify the dashboard THEN they SHALL have a clear single file to edit

### Requirement 3: Remove Unnecessary Test and Verification Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want only essential testing files so that the project structure is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining test files THEN only actively used verification scripts SHALL remain
2. WHEN running setup verification THEN there SHALL be clear, working scripts for both Windows and Linux
3. IF duplicate test files exist THEN only the most comprehensive versions SHALL be kept
4. WHEN developers need to verify setup THEN they SHALL have clear, single-purpose scripts

### Requirement 4: Consolidate Status and Summary Files

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want a single source of truth for project status so that I can understand the current state without reading multiple conflicting documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking project status THEN there SHALL be one comprehensive status document
2. WHEN reviewing what has been implemented THEN the information SHALL be consolidated and current
3. IF multiple summary files exist THEN they SHALL be merged into a single authoritative document
4. WHEN new team members join THEN they SHALL have a clear, single document explaining the project state

### Requirement 5: Maintain Essential Project Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that all working functionality remains intact after cleanup so that the MVP continues to function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN all core functionality SHALL remain working
2. WHEN the MVP is tested THEN all features SHALL continue to operate as before
3. IF a file is essential for operation THEN it SHALL be preserved regardless of apparent redundancy
4. WHEN documentation is consolidated THEN all important information SHALL be retained
