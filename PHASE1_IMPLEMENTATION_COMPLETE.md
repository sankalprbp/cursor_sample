## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, the platform now has:
1. ✅ Complete authentication system
2. ✅ User management with multi-tenancy
3. ✅ Tenant management and administration
4. ✅ Knowledge base upload and management
5. ✅ Basic API endpoints for all core features

The system is ready for:
- Phase 2: Voice Integration (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Twilio)
- Phase 3: Frontend Development
- Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Phase 5: Deployment & Testing

## Testing the Implementation

To test the Phase 1 implementation:

1. Start the services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. The API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

3. API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

4. Test authentication by registering a user:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "admin@example.com",
       "username": "admin",
       "password": "SecurePass123",
       "first_name": "Admin",
       "last_name": "User"
     }'
   ```

5. Login to get access token:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "admin@example.com",
       "password": "SecurePass123"
     }'
   ```

All Phase 1 requirements have been successfully implemented!
