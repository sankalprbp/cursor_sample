# Project Status

This repository contains an early prototype of a multi-tenant AI voice agent platform.

The backend now includes extensive startup debug messages, making it easier to
pinpoint issues when the container launches. The frontend and backend have both
been built locally to verify that dependencies install correctly and that the
Next.js application compiles without errors.

## Current Progress

- **Backend**: FastAPI application builds and starts successfully inside Docker.
  - Uvicorn runs and exposes the API on port 8000.
- **Frontend**: Next.js application builds and shows a login page.
  - Login page now authenticates against the backend using the test accounts created during database initialization.
  - Other pages (admin, docs, etc.) are not implemented and currently return 404 errors.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose brings up Postgres, Redis and MinIO along with the backend and frontend containers. Basic health checks are passing.

## Next Steps

- Extend the authentication system (registration flow, token refresh and logout).
- Build out the missing frontend pages (admin dashboard, documentation, etc.).
- Flesh out backend API endpoints and database models to support the voice agent features.

This file will be updated as development continues.
