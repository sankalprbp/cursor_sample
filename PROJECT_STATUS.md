# Project Status

This repository contains an early prototype of a multi-tenant AI voice agent platform.

## Current Progress

- **Backend**: FastAPI application builds and starts successfully inside Docker.
  - Uvicorn runs and exposes the API on port 8000.
- **Frontend**: Next.js application builds and shows a login page.
  - Other pages (admin, docs, etc.) are not implemented and currently return 404 errors.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose brings up Postgres, Redis and MinIO along with the backend and frontend containers. Basic health checks are passing.

## Next Steps

- Implement actual authentication logic and connect the login page to the backend.
- Build out the missing frontend pages (admin dashboard, documentation, etc.).
- Flesh out backend API endpoints and database models to support the voice agent features.

This file will be updated as development continues.
