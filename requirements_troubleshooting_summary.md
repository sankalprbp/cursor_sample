# Requirements.txt Troubleshooting Session Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes a troubleshooting session for fixing issues with a Python requirements.txt file containing 88 dependencies for a FastAPI backend application.

## Initial Problem
The user encountered multiple issues when attempting to install packages from their requirements.txt file, including:
- Non-existent packages
- Invalid package versions
- Missing system dependencies
- Python version compatibility issues

## Environment Setup Challenges

### External Package Manager Conflict
- **Issue**: Initial pip installation failed due to externally-managed Python environment
- **Solution**: 
  1. Installed `python3.13-venv` package via apt
  2. Created virtual environment
  3. Upgraded pip successfully

## Major Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. PostgreSQL Dependencies
- **Problem**: `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9` failed to build due to missing PostgreSQL development libraries
- **Solution**: Installed system packages:
  - `postgresql-server-dev-all`
  - `libpq-dev`

### 2. Invalid Package Versions
- **Problem**: `cryptography==41.0.8` - version never released (versions skip from 41.0.7 to 42.0.0)
- **Solution**: Changed to `cryptography==41.0.7`

### 3. Incorrect Package Names
- **Problem**: `speech-recognition==3.10.0` - package doesn't exist with this name/version
- **Solution**: Corrected to `SpeechRecognition==3.14.3` (proper PyPI package name)

### 4. Duplicate Dependencies
- **Problems**: 
  - `python-multipart==0.0.6` appeared twice
  - `celery` appeared both standalone and with `[redis]` extra
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed duplicates
  - Kept `celery[redis]==5.3.4`

### 5. Python 3.13 Compatibility Issues
- **Problem**: `pandas==2.1.4` compilation failed due to C API changes in Python 3.13
  - Error: Cython-generated code had incorrect argument counts for `_PyLong_AsByteArray` function calls
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `pandas` to `2.2.3` (Python 3.13 compatible)
  - Updated `numpy` from `1.25.2` to `1.26.4` for compatibility

## Outstanding Issues

### 6. FFmpeg/Multimedia Libraries (Unresolved)
- **Current Blocker**: `aiortc==1.6.0` dependency `av` package compilation failure
- **Root Cause**: Missing FFmpeg development libraries (libavformat, libavcodec, etc.)
- **Status**: Session ended while attempting to resolve this issue
- **Next Steps**: Install FFmpeg development headers to enable `av` package compilation

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **System Dependencies**: Python packages with C extensions often require system development libraries
2. **Version Compatibility**: Always verify package versions exist on PyPI before specifying them
3. **Python Version Support**: Newer Python versions may require updated package versions
4. **Package Naming**: Some packages have different names on PyPI than commonly expected
5. **Duplicate Management**: Regular cleanup of requirements.txt prevents conflicts

## Tools and Packages Involved

### System Packages Installed
- `python3.13-venv`
- `postgresql-server-dev-all`
- `libpq-dev`

### Python Packages Fixed
- `cryptography`: 41.0.8 → 41.0.7
- `SpeechRecognition`: speech-recognition → SpeechRecognition==3.14.3
- `pandas`: 2.1.4 → 2.2.3
- `numpy`: 1.25.2 → 1.26.4
- `celery`: Removed duplicate, kept celery[redis]==5.3.4

## Current Status
- ✅ Virtual environment successfully created
- ✅ PostgreSQL dependencies resolved
- ✅ Package version conflicts fixed
- ✅ Python 3.13 compatibility issues resolved
- ❌ **Blocked**: FFmpeg development libraries needed for `av` package compilation

## Recommended Next Actions
1. Install FFmpeg development libraries on the system
2. Retry package installation
3. Consider alternative packages if multimedia functionality isn't critical
4. Document any additional system dependencies for future deployments
